I was part of a team that redesigned the homepage of the UW-Whitewater website. I developed design layouts and, in conjunction with the Manager of Web Operations and the University Marketing team, fine-tuned the design before it was presented to the Chancellor's Cabinet for approval.

When the site was approved, I worked with our front-end developer to implement the design, including creating design elements for the page, assisting with coding for some of the layouts and content creation.
